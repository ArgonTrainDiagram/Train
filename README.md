# Train

This Argon Train project is based on the film L'arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat (The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station). This film is famous because when it was first shown, it is said that the audience was so overwhelmed by the moving image of a life-sized train coming directly at them that people screamed and ran to the back of the room. 

The user of the program starts off inside of a theater and the movie begins to play when a button on the screen is pressed. When the train comes towards the audience in the movie, a 3D model of a train comes out of the screen.
